Roadmap of DEEP Framework
=========================

Our list of roadmap features and functionality, in descending order of priority:

- [ ] Implement deep-validation: *All Lambda functions must validate input data using deep-validation methods*
- [ ] Display deep-benchmarking link: *If deep-microservices-benchmarking is deployed, would be cool to reference it somewhere on the page*
