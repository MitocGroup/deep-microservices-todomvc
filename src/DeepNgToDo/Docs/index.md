##Windows configuration
  1. Before starting you should have installed and configured correctly node and npm (versions more than 4.2.4 are supported).
  2. Before starting you should install Git Bash.
> It launches a full featured console window running Bash, so you can use Git as well as a set of common command line tools or Unix programs.
Starting with Git version 2, Git Bash will by default launch in MinTTY, a terminal emulator which comes with MSYS2, making it easily usable even for users not accustomed to a console experience.

    2.1. Download [Git Bash](http://git-scm.com/) and launch installer for it.
